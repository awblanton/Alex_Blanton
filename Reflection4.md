# The Effect of Weather on Match Results

Efforts to predict the results of soccer matches have been going on since the sport began by teams, fans, and oddsmakers. For teams any advantage that they can be given in predicting match results is helpful as  it can aid them in picking out actions they can do to get a more favorable result. For fans being able to predict results is important as many fans enjoy trying to predict the score of the game beforehand, it can help temper fans expectations creating less pressure for the clubs, and it can help fans judge how well their teams are performing. For oddsmakers and bettors having any extra knowledge about predicting the result of a game can help them make a greater profit and diminish their losses. Recently various uses of machine learning have gained prevalence within the soccer community to predict the results of matches based on everything from individual statistics to past results (Iskandaryan et al. 2-4). While these models cover many of the on field events that can be controlled by the players and the staff the weather is something that had never been factored into a model that predicts results before (5). Weather has an important impact on the result of the game as weather data combined with results can lead to a model that is accurate at predicting the results of games and it can help teams be better prepared for games and give oddsmakers a more accurate prediction (1).

 The researchers started creating their model by pairing the results of the top two leagues in Spain from the 13-14 season to the 17-18 season, match odds, and weather data from the nearest weather station (1, 10, 13). After selecting the data, the researchers performed data feature engineering in order to improve computational time and make the data set more inclusive. The researchers used synthetic minority over sampling technique in order to help fill out gaps in the data set that lacked weather data (19). They then used recursive feature elimination with cross validation which selects and removes the weakest points in the data (19). The p-value was calculated and anything with a higher p-value then 0.05 was also removed from the data (19). The resulting features were used in one of two case studies, one of which was predicting a home win, a draw, or and away win while the other only predicted whether a team won (9). The researchers created a test set with 20 percent of the data and a training set with 80 percent of the data and they used k-fold cross validation which sets the hyperparameters of their models and they used a grid search which searches through a set space to optimize their hyperparameters(21, 22). The researchers created 4 different models in order to compare them to see which is the best for each case study (24-27). They created a Random Forest model which creates many different decision trees and combines them in order to create an accurate model (24). Extremely Randomized Trees created a model that combined them based on random cut off points which can reduce the variance of the model (25). They used a Support Vector Machine which created hyperplanes and selected the one with the greatest margin (26). The K–Nearest Neighbor Search searches for the most similar results as it tries to find the most similar events (27). The results were measured based on accuracy, a confusion matrix, which is the types of error and the correct results, and the area under the true positive and the false positive curve (28-32).

 For all of the models the inclusion of weather data made them significantly more accurate, especially for the 1st case study, than if they excluded the weather, with the exception of the K-Nearest Neighbor Search which did slightly worse without the weather data on the second case study (42-44). All that performing slightly worse demonstrated in this instance is that they weather data in that model was not relevant in predicting the results correctly (44). For the 1st case study, the accuracies of the models ranged from 62.1 percent and 65.9 percent with the Extremely Randomized Trees being the best (42). This means that the models can predict the correct result of a game somewhat reliably based on the weather and odds of a game. In the 2nd case study, the results vary from 71.1 and 79.3 percent with the Support Vector Machine being the most accurate at predicting whether the game was a draw or a win (42). For the 1st case study, the primary mistake by the models was awarding a draw when it was actually a home win while the 2nd would mistake a win when there was a draw (45). These results are important to fans as they can understand the impact that playing in different weather can have on their team. It can help oddsmakers and bettors as it can demonstrate the increased or decreased likelihood of a team winning based on how different the weather is. For teams it can help them prepare themselves for playing in harsher environments and understand what kind of weather gives their team an advantage. The problems with the data set include the hostile environment faced by away teams, the staggered schedule of games, and the fact weather channels are not the actual stadiums (45). Future works could include more data like the altitude or the air quality in a city, but this is a promising start to the use of weather aiding in the predicting of soccer games (46). Weather does have an impact on the result matches meaning that there is truth behind the old soccer cliché “Can he do it on a cold, rainy Tuesday night in Stoke?” as the weather does play an impact on the way teams perform.
