# Data Science in the World

Recently the field of data science has seen a massive spike in its popularity and usage due to technological advances and “revolutions in measurement (Aral)”. These advances have made it possible for the world that we live in to be understood in ways that it never has before as it is much easier for people to see the connections between things in all fields, giving people a more complex insight. The better computer technology has made it possible for models to be created more efficiently as computers take are more powerful and take up less space. The refinement of old and creation of new measurement techniques has made it possible for data scientists to hone in on a specific goal and have a better understanding of it. This allows people to no longer have to rely on hand calculated models and what they think they observe which allows facts to be dominate rather than word of mouth. The use of data science has allowed people around the world to have a better understanding of the way that a society develops and understand how humans interact. 


The use of data science can show how a country develops over time and the important factors in the development of that nation. For a developing country that lacks good infrastructure of healthcare it can show what things are conducive with regards to the creation of larger settlements, for instance a hospital may be a popular place for people to settle around since they have greater access to healthcare. Another potential example of this could be with regards to roads as areas with better infrastructure have larger settlements as it is easier to move around and get access to goods. In a nation like the United States development could be shown through mapping things like diversity by showing where people live and in what concentrations. This could help show in what areas the nation is growing more diverse and in what areas the country could be growing backwards. In all countries it can help correlate what is important to people be demonstrating things their religion or language showing what potential barriers there are within nations. The use of data science can also show potential centers of power within regions and the world by offering comparisons of things like militaries, GDP, or even subjective things like the freedom of the press, allowing people to make a more holistic assessment of a country. By making better assessments about nations and individual regions it makes it possible for policy makers to create better plans to aid the people where they live. For instance if there was a lack of a reliable water supply for a region, a model could be created to find not only the most efficient way to get the water, but the most efficient place to put it to based on where the population resides. 


Data science can help with not only the economy as a whole, but also individual industries and businesses. With regards to the entire economy a data scientist could chart a countries imports, exports, GDP, or what portion of money was spent on what goods for the entire nation. Another thing that can be determined by data science is ways in which the economy is changing, showing whether the economy is improving or declining. This can guide policy makers when it comes to making economic decisions as it can help them see where money is spent and who their strongest economic partners are, but it can let companies see which fields are growing and those that are declining. Data science can help individual industries by helping perform a key part of their industry at a higher level or add something new that could help their industry. For instance improvements in data science have made it harder for people to steal due to better security systems that incorporate data science, while another field that has seen improvement is the gambling industry as many events have become easier to predict based solely off of data science. In both of these scenarios it allows companies to try and maximize their revenue by limiting their potential losses which can help the economy as a whole. Individual businesses can be aided by data science in a plethora of ways it can be applied due to the many variables that go into creating a successful business. In an individual business data science can be used to do anything from isolate goods that are not worth selling, determining certain times of the year with heightened profit, and it can help determine whether opening an additional location would be beneficial. 


The use of data science can be applied in almost every aspect of our lives or the world due to its ability to recognize and determine things that apply to whatever is being studied. On a larger scale this is useful for decision makers in charge of large groups, like the government, charities, or businesses as they can see what a smarter decision would be based on what their models say. On a more individual level it can benefit people by informing them about issues that are important to them like sports, social justice, or eating healthier. Data science can help with anything if there is an accurate model as it can help us have a better understanding of our world today, make better decisions, and predict the future.
