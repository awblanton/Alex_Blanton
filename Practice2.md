# Complex Graph

![](Rplot_with_10_points)

In this graph set the x and y values for 1 through 100 and randomly sampled 10 points while calling the x value east and the y value north. Then to plot the points I used symbol() to set the size and the shape. I then set the sample within the symbol() command and created different color and size circles. I then created a data frame called dwelling using a dataframe by using cbind.data.frame(). I then created lines using the lines() and text () command which went between 10 points that from the dwelling dataframe.
