To create this graph I followed the instructions on the github site. I started by giving x the values of 1-10 and y the values of 10-1. Once I did this I typed plot (x,y) and it gave me a much simpler graph. I then added type "o" to the graph which gave it data points and a line connecting all of the points. After that I typed in the labels for the x and y axis and gave the graph a title. I then changed line weight, line color, line type, symbol type, symbol size, and symbol color following the instructions on the website. The most difficult part of this for me was adding the axis and title since I kept making mistake when typing it in so it would not work.
