Hi, my name is Alex Blanton. I am from Roanoke, Virginia and went to Cave Spring High School which is in the southwest part of the state. I want to double major in business and economics. I am very interested in working in some sort of a role for a professional sports team and that is part of what made me interested in data science. I really enjoy soccer and the emerging analytic and statical side of the game is fascinating to me and made me want to learn more about data science.
