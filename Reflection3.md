# Measuring Pass Value in Soccer Games

There are many basic statistics taken in soccer like shots, passes, and tackles that can be recorded by observing the game closely. While these stats do have some use, they do not offer much insight into what is happening on the field due to the wide variety of ways a game can playout. For example, Player A could complete all their passes, but every pass goes backwards, whereas Player B could complete 5 out of 20 passes but all of them created a chance to score a goal. If you were simply shown the basic statistics you would think that Player A out performed Player B, but if you look more in depth into the statistics you would see player B was actually contributing more to the team than Player A. Researchers developed a model that calculates how much value an individual pass gives to a team and then used this to determine which players offered a large value to their team and those who offer little to no value to their team in possession(Brefeld, Ulf, et al. 3). 


The researchers used all the games in the top 5 leagues, the first divisions in England, Spain, Italy, Germany, and France, plus the Eredivise, the Netherlands, and the Jupiler League, Belgium which equates to 9061 games  or 1878,593 individual possession sequences(4, 7). This data was then divided into a training set of 4253 games and a validation and test set of 2404(7). In order to create this model, the researchers started by using expected goals (xG), which is the likelihood that a player scores given that they take a shot from a certain position on the field. The researchers used XGBoost in order to create the xG model which is used in calculating the value of a possession sequence, a time when one team retains possession of the ball without a turnover or a break in the game like a foul(5,8). Each passes value is calculated as the likelihood that it will be part of a sequence that leads to a shot with a value of 0 being awarded to a sequence that doesn’t lead to a shot and the value of the xG of the shot being awarded when a shot is taken(5). A pass that increases the likelihood of a team scoring a goal will be given a positive value as in increases the likelihood of a goal while a pass that does not increase the likelihood is considered negative. In order to make it less time consuming of a model the researchers use k-nearest neighbor search which is when the model searches for a set number of similar sequences, in this case 10 (9,10). In addition to the k-nearest neighbor search the researchers used dynamic time warping in order to help determine what sequences were the closest (6). In order to do this, they divided the field into 15 meter by 17 meter grids, or a 7 x 4 grid, and their training set determined those that were similar in order to create a value for the passes (6, 8). They initially used the model with the training set then they repeated it and got similar results with the validation set meaning that their model was accurate (8). They then use their model in order to try and predict the results of games in the test set based on the passing and to understand how well the players perform (8, 11). Their model was able to show which players contributed the most xG through their passes per game to Ragnar Klavan, a Liverpool defender (11). One thing to note about their model is that players needed 900 minutes in order to be evaluated so that a handful of games could not give a player a misleadingly high value and some players could have a high value of passing, but that could be through quantity rather than quality(8, 11). 



Being able to value passes is important to teams as it can show which players are contributing to the build up of goals and those who are hurting the team in possession. Going back to the example in the first paragraph Player A is less useful than he appears in the base statistics than Player B as despite his significantly higher completion percentage he has a much a much lower value in his passes as Player B’s riskier passes have a much higher value when completed. This can help teams evaluate replacements for players as they can find players who fit the mold of the outgoing player by looking at number of passes per 90, or game, the value of passing per 90, and the pass accuracy per 90 (12, 13). While this use can be beneficial for helping teams, it does not offer the whole picture of a player since it completely discounts important parts of the game. It does not even offer a complete picture of how the players pass as they could have identical xG and play different kinds of passes. This is a promising first step into being able to more completely understanding how passing contributes to the game of soccer, but further models could offer much more precision into the value of passes by including opponent strength and by including more data about the type of pass and position of players (14).
